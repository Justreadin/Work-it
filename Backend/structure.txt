Explanation of the Project Structure:
Backend/
This is the root directory of the backend application.

tests/
This directory contains the test files for various components of the backend:

auth.test.js: Tests for authentication-related routes and functionality (e.g., login, registration).

userController.test.js: Tests for the functions in the userController.js, such as registering a user, saving personal information, etc.

utils.test.js: Tests for utility functions like OTP generation and email handling.

server.js
This is the main entry point of the application. It initializes the server, configures middleware, connects to the database, and listens for incoming HTTP requests.

config/
This directory contains configuration files for various parts of the application:

db.js: Contains database connection configurations, e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL configurations.

redis.js: Configures the Redis client used for caching and session management.

rateLimit.js: Contains rate-limiting configurations to prevent abuse of the API (e.g., limiting requests per minute).

controllers/
This directory holds the controllers that handle the business logic for different routes:

userController.js: Contains functions like registerUser, loginUser, savePersonalInformation, etc., that interact with models and return responses to the client.

models/
This directory contains the data models that interface with the database:

userModel.js: Contains functions for interacting with the user-related data, such as getting user information, saving personal information, etc.

routes/
This directory defines the routes for handling incoming API requests:

api.js: Contains routes related to general API functionality.

auth.js: Contains authentication routes (e.g., login, registration, and user authentication).

jobs/
This directory holds files for managing background jobs:

otpQueue.js: Contains logic for queueing OTP generation and email sending jobs.

emailQueue.js: Contains logic for queuing and sending emails (e.g., for verification).

middlewares/
This directory contains middleware functions that execute during the request lifecycle:

authMiddleware.js: Middleware for checking if the user is authenticated by verifying the JWT.

errorHandler.js: Middleware for handling errors globally in the app.

validateInput.js: Middleware to validate user input before it reaches the controller.

utils/
This directory contains utility functions that are shared across the app:

sendOtp.js: Utility function to generate and send OTP to users.

mailService.js: Contains functions related to sending emails (e.g., for OTP verification).

logger.js: Utility for logging errors and general information to monitor application health.

uploads/
This directory stores uploaded files, such as user profile pictures or documents.

.env
This file holds environment variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys, and JWT secrets) that are used throughout the application.

.gitignore
This file specifies which files and directories Git should ignore (e.g., node_modules, uploads, .env file).

package.json
This file contains metadata about the project, including dependencies, scripts, and project information like name, version, etc.

package-lock.json
This file locks the versions of the dependencies to ensure consistency across installations.

README.md
This file contains documentation for the project, including setup instructions, usage, and any additional information for developers or users.

In summary:
tests/ handles testing.

controllers/ contains the logic for handling requests.

models/ deals with the database and data persistence.

routes/ defines the API endpoints.

jobs/ handles background tasks like OTP generation and email sending.

middlewares/ manages request processing (authentication, validation, error handling).

utils/ holds utility functions that are used throughout the app.
